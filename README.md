```

```js

// server.js
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all routes


app.get('/', (req,res)=>{
    res.send("Server is running");
})

// Define the POST route
app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const userMessage = req.body.message;

  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'url',
    headers: {
      'x-rapidapi-key': 'key',
      'x-rapidapi-host': 'host',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    data: {
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: userMessage
        }
      ]
    }
  };

  try {
    const response = await axios.request(options);
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data from AI:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch AI response' });
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

```
